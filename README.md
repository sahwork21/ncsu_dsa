This contains all the data structures, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms I was responsible for creating during a semester long course at NC State University. 
Completing these workshops helped me to understand the inner mechanizations of these data structures and how these can be implemented without a library and in a faster manner than the provided Java libraries.
